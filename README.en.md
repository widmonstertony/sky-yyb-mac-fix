# Sky China PC on macOS through Tencent YYB

An unofficial repair tool that installs and launches the NetEase China PC edition of *Sky: Children of the Light* through Tencent YYB's bundled Windows-game engine on verified M2, M4, and Intel Macs.

It preserves the required Fever Games login flow, enables true Retina backing, repairs per-process DPI awareness and pointer scaling, and applies 60 FPS/no-motion-blur/windowed preferences. The windowed setting keeps the native macOS close, minimize, and fullscreen titlebar controls available; this has been verified across relaunches on Intel, while the M2/M4 titlebar result still needs a hardware retest. Verified M2 and M4 systems use the same hash-pinned `winevulkan.dll` from YYB engine 1.10.41, so both apply the same Vulkan interoperability fix: report the feature and desktop-GPU identity required by Sky's startup checks, then remove the unsupported geometry-shader request before `vkCreateDevice` reaches MoltenVK. The original DLL, every replaced instruction sequence, and the transformed result are verified before writing, and the local original is backed up. No game, launcher, Wine, token, or copyrighted binary is included.

See the [Chinese README](README.md) for the verified configuration, one-click instructions, limitations, safety notes, and troubleshooting.

Quick start: install and open [Tencent YYB for macOS](https://sj.qq.com/download) once (choose the Apple-silicon Mac build), download this repository, then double-click `install.command`. On M2/M4, open NetEase Fever normally and press **Start Game** for Sky. `launch.command` opens that verified path. After Sky has created its full preferences file, rerun `install.command` with the game closed to make windowed mode the default. On the verified M4 setup, the standalone Launchpad Sky icon is wrapped so it opens or focuses Fever instead of invoking YYB's broken child shortcut and returning `errCode:-1`; the original executable is backed up and restorable.

The binary patch is applied only when the chip is exactly Apple M2 or Apple M4 and the local DLL exactly matches the verified build. M2/M4 variants and unknown YYB engine builds are rejected rather than patched by fixed offset.

On Intel, the same `install.command` automatically uses Tencent's SHA-256-pinned legacy x86_64 engine, installs Windows Steam and Fever Games, enables true Retina rendering, and mirrors installed games into macOS Launchpad. It also installs a native **Windows Games** library app, with launcher/game cards, manual Launchpad sync, and one-click Retina/DPI/60 FPS re-application; its application structure is adapted from the MIT-licensed [Mac Wine Launcher](https://github.com/MrBurge2000/mac-wine-launcher). Native launcher hosts subscribe directly to YYB Wine window events, so games opened inside Steam or Fever acquire their own macOS App/Dock lifecycle without a resident process-polling daemon; file events update newly installed Launchpad entries. Because the legacy engine's Fever download IPC stalls on current macOS, an explicit Sky download click is resumed from NetEase's public official manifest/CDN with per-file MD5 verification. No proprietary binary is stored in this repository. MetalFX/frame generation is not available in this Intel engine.

## Extra: Stellar Blade on Apple M4

If Stellar Blade is already installed through the Windows Steam client inside
YYB, run `python3 stellar_blade_fix.py`. This applies 3840x2160 output, 2x
Retina backing, FSR 3 Performance upscaling and frame interpolation, with a 120
FPS cap. Character detail and textures are prioritized while expensive environment
settings are reduced for a 16 GB unified-memory Mac. Depth of field, motion
blur, chromatic aberration, and film grain are disabled for a clearer subject.
The output remains physical 4K; FSR reconstructs it from an approximately
1920x1080 internal image to create headroom for 60 FPS or better. The script backs
up every changed file and does not alter the Sky Vulkan patch or save data.
